My name is Alberto. I am a PhD student in economics at KU Leuven in Belgium, working under the supervision of [Christian Proebsting](https://sites.google.com/site/proebstingchristian/home).

My research interest lies in (international) macroeconomics, where I study how shocks propagate across regions within a country or among countries in a monetary union. I combine novel microdata to analyze the local effects of aggregate shocks with structural models to study their implications for aggregate and distributional outcomes.

My research is funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) fundamental research grant.

I grew up in the beautiful wine region of [La Rioja](https://www.spain.info/en/region/la-rioja/), in Northern Spain.
